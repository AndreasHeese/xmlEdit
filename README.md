# xmlEdit
Editor for XML-files made with Saxon-JS 2.1

After a Hello World approach this is my first try with Saxon-JS and XSLT 3.0 in the browser. Would it be able to realize a XML editor? It is, but it's only capable of editing the text values of elements and attributes yet. No comments or processing instructions and no structure changes. Everything happens client side.

Check it out running on [GitHub Pages](https://andreasheese.github.io/xmlEdit/xmlEdit.html).
